Nothing: 0 //group 0 //count 1

static blocks: 1, 2 //group 1 //count 2

blocks and bombs: 10, 11, 12 //group 2 //count 3

bombs: 5, 8 // group 3 //count 2
 
moving blocks un-timed: 13, 7 //group 4 //count 2

moving blocks timed -> ledges: 3, 4, 6, 9 //group 5 //count 4

moving blocks timed -> shuffling to avoid getting blocked: 17, 15, 16, 14, 20 //group 6 //count 5

moving blocks timed -> something blocking the entrance so you have to time the entrance: 23, 18//group 7 //count 2

moving blocks timed with red lines -> 19, 21, 22, 24, 25 // group 8 // count 5

using multiple shapes to plug holes etc. -> 25, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33  // group 9 // count 8

mirrorred levels -> 26 // group 10 // count 1


Manevouring the shape 
	- just blocks
	- blocks with bombs 
	- timed blocks (windmill type shapes)

Ledges
	- have to use ledge to prop shape on so they don't hit the bombs below

On/Off blocks shuffling
   - Have to time it to get into all the crevices. 

Incoming to a level 
	- have to time the start so you don't get caught at the top

Extra Shapes can finish lines (red lines not just green lines)
	- have to time the on/off shapes to finish a line

Linking shapes together 
	- bomb blows whole in shape, have to link it to complete the level
	- the level can start with more than one shape, so have to use them together 

Colors
	- only certain blocks can pass through colors or the shape will blow up 

Camera moving 
	- really big levels involving manuvering the camera to finish lines -> more of a pushing things to the limit 

Mirrored levels
