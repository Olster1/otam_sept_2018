I learnt to program from Casey Muratori's Handmade Hero series, and had been following Jon Blow's talks before this, and really like the idea of games being a medium which expand people's mind, like a good novel or movie. In this game I tried my hand at designing such a game.

I plan to make the game available for windows/mac/linux and android/apple touch devices.

The team is just myself, Oliver, doing the programming and game design. The artwork and sound effects are in the public domain, and the current music is by my brother. 

The game is programmed in C using SDL & OpenGL. 

I will do most of the programming, but i may need to hire someone to (but possible won't):
- help optimise the game, and solve any bugs I can't work out
- help port it to android & apple touch devices.

This will probably be someone from the Handmade Network forums.  

I'm asking for $5000 to have more time to explore the levels, and make the game the best it possibly can be. I probably won't be changing it significantly from the way it is. Only adding more game mechanics if needed & a level editor for users. 

The money will go towards general living expenses (food, accomidation while I work on the game) & as well as approx. $500 - $1000 for another programmer to consult.  

I plan the game will ship around March next year on Steam, itch.io and the apple store & google play stores.

If you think the game has merit, I would also love any advice & guidance on what I could do to make the game better, more enjoyable. etc. 

I would love to be able to make & design games for a living and go on to create more creative and interesting games in the future.
